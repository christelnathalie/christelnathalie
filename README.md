- 👋 Hi, I’m Christel — currently on the path to becoming a Data Engineer.
- 🎓 I hold a Master’s degree in Cultural Politics, with a specialization in Performing Arts  
- 💡 I love to explore and develop how AI, technology, and data are reshaping the cultural landscape — and society as a whole  
- 🌱 Currently diving into my second favorite playground: data! I’m learning Python and Statistics for Data Science and Business Intelligence  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her  
- 🧠 Motto: *Data science is just another form of dramaturgy.*
